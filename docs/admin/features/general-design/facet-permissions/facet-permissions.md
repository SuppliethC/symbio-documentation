# Facet Permissions

With this feature Admins are able to assign permissions to a specific facet. These permissions are then valid for all elements within the facet and are added to the default permissions of the Users.

Please refer to [The facet permissions feature](/docs/admin/administration/permissions/facet-permission-feature.md) for more details.
