## Permissions maintenance extension

With the activation of this feature, the permissions assignment is made more flexible and easier than it is in the standard.

The permissions are set directly at the selected process or object.

Please proceed as follows:

### 1. Choose __Inherit permissions__

There are three different possibilities to define on which basis the permissions are set up:

- Inherit from parent:
Permissions of the selected process or object are adopted from parent element.

- Starting from default permissions:
Permissions are set on the basis of the application roles set in User admin area (e.g. Author, Architect etc.).

- Starting without any permissions:
Permissions are completely redefined.

### 2. Define affectance with __Other users__

You can choose between two options:

- Other users have no permissions:
This permission is exclusively set for a specific User or User group. For other users, no permissions have been defined.

- Permissions of other users unchanged:
Permissions of other users remain unaffected.
